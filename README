Prewikka: The Prelude-IDS console.

Originally written by Markus Alkio and Miika Keskinen, today written by Nicolas Delon, 
it was rapidly adopted as the new Prelude frontend.
Prewikka is a professional looking application providing advanced feature like contextual filtering,
aggregation, etc.
Prewikka is a large step forward compared to Piwi.
As of now, Prewikka use advanced CSS features and won't work under Internet Explorer. We'll be working
on fixing this ASAP (and any help would be appreciated).
