Prewikka: The Prelude-IDS console.
Prewikka is brought to you by CS-SI (http://www.prelude-ids.com).


Prewikka Overview
=================

Originally written by Markus Alkio and Miika Keskinen, re-written and maintained by 
Nicolas Delon with the help of Yoann Vandoorselaere and Audrey Girard, on behalf of 
PreludeIDS Technologies, it was rapidly adopted as the new Prelude frontend. 

Prewikka is a professional looking application providing advanced features like
contextual filtering, aggregation, etc.
